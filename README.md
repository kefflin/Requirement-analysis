# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

Welcome to the **Requirement Analysis** repository. This repository is dedicated to documenting and managing the process of requirement analysis in software development projects.

Requirement analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that involves gathering, analyzing, validating, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders. The purpose of this repository is to provide structured documentation, templates, and guidelines that ensure clear communication between clients, developers, and project managers.

Whether you're working on a small application or a large enterprise system, this repository will help you define functional and non-functional requirements, maintain traceability, and avoid common pitfalls that arise from poorly defined project scopes.

# What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a fundamental phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs, expectations, and constraints of stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and documented to define the scope of a software project. This process ensures that the development team fully understands what the end-users and clients expect from the software system before any design or coding begins.

Key Activities in Requirement Analysis:
Requirement Gathering: Collecting information from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, observations, and documentation.

Requirement Elicitation: Engaging stakeholders to uncover implicit needs and expectations that may not be immediately obvious.

Requirement Documentation: Organizing and recording requirements in structured formats such as Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documents, user stories, or use cases.

Requirement Validation: Ensuring that the gathered requirements are accurate, complete, feasible, and aligned with business objectives.

Requirement Management: Maintaining and tracking requirements throughout the project lifecycle to handle changes and ensure traceability.

Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC:
Foundation for Development: Clearly defined requirements provide a solid foundation for system design, development, and testing.

Minimizes Project Risks: Helps in identifying potential conflicts, ambiguities, or unrealistic expectations early in the process.

Improves Communication: Acts as a reference point that aligns the understanding of clients, developers, testers, and project managers.

Cost and Time Efficiency: Well-analyzed requirements reduce rework, project delays, and cost overruns caused by scope creep or misunderstood requirements.

Enhances Product Quality: Ensures that the final software product meets user needs and performs as expected in its intended environment.

Effective requirement analysis bridges the gap between what stakeholders expect and what developers deliver, making it a critical success factor for any software project.

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis plays a pivotal role in the success of software development projects. It lays the groundwork for the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) by ensuring that all stakeholders share a clear and common understanding of what the software is expected to achieve. Below are three key reasons why Requirement Analysis is critical:

1. Prevents Miscommunication and Misunderstandings
Requirement Analysis establishes a clear line of communication between stakeholders, including clients, project managers, developers, and testers. By documenting explicit and detailed requirements, it minimizes assumptions and ambiguities, ensuring everyone is aligned on the project’s objectives.

2. Reduces Cost and Time Overruns
Identifying and addressing requirements early in the SDLC helps avoid costly changes and rework during later stages of development. A thorough requirement analysis reduces the chances of scope creep, project delays, and budget overruns by setting clear expectations from the outset.

3. Ensures Delivery of Quality Software Solutions
A well-defined set of requirements ensures that the final product meets the user’s needs and performs reliably in real-world scenarios. Requirement Analysis contributes to building software that aligns with business goals, enhances user satisfaction, and complies with technical and regulatory standards.

# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves several critical activities that help ensure a clear understanding of what the software should achieve. The five key activities are:

.Requirement Gathering:

  .Involves collecting information about the needs and expectations of stakeholders (clients, users, management).

  .Techniques include interviews, questionnaires, workshops, observations, and reviewing existing documentation.

.Requirement Elicitation:

  .Focuses on uncovering implicit, hidden, or unclear needs that stakeholders may not express directly.

  .Involves brainstorming sessions, prototyping, use case development, and scenario analysis to explore user needs in depth.

.Requirement Documentation:

  .Captures and organizes all gathered requirements in a structured format.

  .Common documentation includes Software Requirements Specification (SRS), User Stories, Use Cases, and Requirement Traceability        Matrices (RTM).

.Requirement Analysis and Modeling:

  .Involves analyzing gathered requirements to detect conflicts, redundancies, or gaps.

  .Uses visual models like Data Flow Diagrams (DFD), Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD), and Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams    to represent system requirements.

.Requirement Validation:

  .Ensures that the documented requirements are correct, complete, feasible, and aligned with stakeholder expectations.

  .Activities include requirement reviews, walkthroughs, and formal approval from stakeholders to verify accuracy and acceptance.
  
#Types of Requirements.

In software development, requirements are generally classified into Functional Requirements and Non-functional Requirements. Understanding the distinction between the two is essential for building a system that not only performs its intended tasks but also meets quality standards.

+Functional Requirements
Functional Requirements define what the system should do. They describe the specific behaviors, features, and functions that the software must support to meet the business objectives.

Definition:
Functional Requirements specify the system's functional aspects, outlining the tasks, data handling, and operations the system must perform.

Examples for a Booking Management Project:
The system shall allow users to create, modify, and cancel bookings.

The system shall send booking confirmation emails to users upon successful reservation.

The admin shall be able to view and manage all booking records from a centralized dashboard.

The system shall allow users to filter available booking slots by date, time, and location.

The system shall automatically update availability when a booking is confirmed or cancelled.

Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional Requirements define how the system should perform. They describe the quality attributes of the system, such as performance, security, usability, and scalability.

Definition:
Non-functional Requirements specify the system's operational characteristics, setting constraints and standards for how the system functions rather than what it does.

Examples for a Booking Management Project:
The system shall be able to handle up to 1,000 concurrent booking requests without performance degradation.

The system shall ensure all user data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.

The system shall have an uptime availability of 99.9% per month.

The booking interface shall load within 3 seconds on mobile and desktop devices.

The system shall support multi-language interfaces, including English and Swahili.

The system shall comply with GDPR and local data protection regulations.
